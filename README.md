Quick start to see how it all works. 
-- Start the virtual environment (in VS Code, select the interpreter from the venv folder)
-- pip install -r requirements.txt
-- Run w/ debugging (F5) OR from within the django folder 'python manage.py runserver'
-- When debugging, it will be port 6969, otherwise default is 8000
